Selection sort: helpful because it helps us in searching for the smallest element in the unsorted sublist.

Some sorting algorithms have better time and/or memory efficiency than others. It really depends on the applications and what the program is trying to accomplish.

Merge sort:  It allows to programmer to sort the data structure in half, from this it then merges the sorted sub arrays into one.

Bubble Sort: Slowest sorting algorithm that works by comparing each pair of elements in the given order.

Analyzing the performance of algorithms - Being able to analyze the performance of algorithms is important as generally the faster, more efficient algorithm is preferable

Selection sort - This is important to know because it works well with smaller lists and has good memory usage

Linear search: Searching is a common task and linear search is one way to search, linear search means to look for an element in an array or list and inspeacting it.

Quick sortï¼šquick sort is useful for sorting array. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot
