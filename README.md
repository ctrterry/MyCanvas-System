# Canvas System Refactoring Project

## Project Overview

This project involved refactoring and optimizing the Canvas system using advanced C++ techniques. In this collaborative development effort guided by Professor Dr. Jim D. Pham, I focused on enhancing the system's maintainability, modularity, and overall performance.

## Project Objectives

- Reconstruct the Canvas system for improved maintainability.
- Enhance code readability through modular architectural design.
- Improve runtime efficiency and system responsiveness.
- Apply modern C++ concepts and memory management techniques.

## Key Contributions

### Modular Architecture Design
- Conducted detailed analysis to identify weaknesses in the existing system structure.
- Redesigned the system with clearly defined modules to enhance maintainability and scalability.

### Component Development
- **Rendering Engine**: Created a high-performance rendering engine using optimized memory handling techniques.
- **Input Handler**: Developed an efficient input handling mechanism, significantly improving user interaction responsiveness.
- **Object Manager**: Built an effective object management system to handle dynamic object creation, modification, and deletion efficiently.

### Advanced C++ Implementation
- Employed pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and smart pointers for better memory management.
- Ensured adherence to best practices to prevent memory leaks and improve system stability.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout this project, I significantly improved my skills in:
- **System Architecture**: Learned to conceptualize and implement a modular software design.
- **Advanced C++ Features**: Deepened understanding of pointers, memory management, dynamic allocation, and object lifecycle.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced code efficiency and optimized system performance.
- **Collaborative Development:** Experienced practical team-oriented development and effective communication.
- **Code Maintainability:** Developed practices for writing clear, maintainable, and modular code.

## Project Impact

The refactored Canvas system achieved:
- Improved overall system performance and user responsiveness.
- Reduced complexity, making future maintenance and feature addition significantly easier.
- A flexible and robust foundation ready for further development.
